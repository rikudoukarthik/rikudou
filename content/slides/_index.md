title: Slide decks
author: Karthik Thrikkadeeri
description: |
  Curated list of slide decks I've created for conferences, talks, or just for sharing resources/ideas. I prefer to make slide decks using Quarto and previously RMarkdown (using [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)), over PowerPoint and its kin. Here, I share the slides along with their source code, videos, and other linkable resources.

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside slides/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
