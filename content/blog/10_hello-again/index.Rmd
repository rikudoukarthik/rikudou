[Hello](https://kartrick.com/blog/hello/) again!

It's been close to two years now since I last posted on my blog. Naturally, a lot has changed.

First of all, more than 11 years after I first registered with WordPress, I have decided to move on. This decision had been made quite some time ago, as I became increasingly fascinated with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and parallelly with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). My first leap into the world of RMarkdown was [creating my CV](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/vitae/blob/main/CV.Rmd), whereas more recently I use it to make most of [my slide decks](https://kartrick.com/talk/) as well. 

```{r xaringan, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#41")
```

Migrating an entire blog, albeit with very few posts, wound up being quite the task---if you're at all familiar with anything R, lRning curves are steep! Long story short, it took me a while to learn how website-building using RMarkdown works, and to migrate all my blog posts here while also adding more elements to turn the erstwhile blog into a website.

My stubbornness hasn't helped, of course. I wanted to resolve all issues and make this website look perfect before consummating it with posts and publicity. However, passing birthdays have nudged me to the point where I have now decided to proceed even with the unresolved issues. One good thing is that any reader can suggest edits or make corrections (for even stuff like typos), because the [source code](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/rikudou) for the entire website is open and accessible on GitHub. I'm actually pleased with how it has turned out, and excited to make use of the data manipulation capabilities of R as well as the typesetting/formatting prowess of Markdown/LaTeX. 

Now, on to personal changes. Since the last time I posted, I earned my Master's degree in Ecology; I scrambled around Czech Republic and a couple other countries on a mad bird-and-travel rush in my last month in Europe, after having been unable to travel for the majority of two years; I went rock-climbing for the first time; said farewells to some beautiful souls; started my first job; moved back to my "home city"; had reunions with some beautiful souls, and found several new ones; got myself a few bucket list items; experienced a few bucket list places, geographies and landscapes; spent an entire 30-hour+ train journey working, and made my first first-author manuscript submission from inside said train; gave an entrance exam in memory of school days; fell even further in love with the written word; made many many travel and birding stories.

Although I'm still as lost as I was in the larger scheme of things, it feels as if the entropy has been channelled into a handful of disjunct but proximate paths. And I've grabbed my popcorn, and lurched into a comfortable yet resolute recline, and I'm here to enjoy the ride.

Until next time.
