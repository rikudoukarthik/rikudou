  title: The Page of Six Paths

    Welcome to my blog! I like to think of the blog as a high-level notebook of my life, which explains why most posts are assigned the "Notebooks" category. I have had several blogs in the past, under various names. The latest before this one was called The Page of Six Paths---on brand with my widespread internet username *rikudoukarthik* (read the lore [here](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hagoromo_%C5%8Ctsutsuki))---and I decided to keep the name. Don't hesitate to share your thoughts on any post!

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
