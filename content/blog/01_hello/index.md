My name is Karthik Thrikkadeeri. I am 20 years old, and India is what I call “home”. However, I am currently studying Master of Science in Ecology, in the Czech Republic. Some of my interests include wildlife/ecology, reading, travelling, minimalism, a bit of philosophy, personal growth, aaand… writing.

Eight years ago, I had started a blog. Or rather, multiple blogs (I don’t even remember the details). I ended up settling on one of them, and it ran for around 4-5 years. It’s hard to fit a genre on the kind of content I was putting out. But it essentially served as an outlet for my crazy ideas. Although today I cringe at almost every sentence from my old posts, I have still retained the blog as it was, simply because it is interesting to look back at my past self.

Well, a lot has changed since then, and I have learned several things while I’ve also unlearned some. I now think in ways that I never did before. A lot more things make sense to me now. I have discovered and learned a lot about myself and life in general. At the same time, this has also opened up numerous challenges for myself. There are many questions I need to answer for myself, many ideas to be put to the test, and simply many more things to discover about who I am and who I want to be. And who knows how long that will take, or where it will take me?

I am currently a “lost” soul, but I accept that with open arms. I have lately figured out what kind of writing appeals to me, and I intend to work on my own. I also believe that one’s experiences and adventures lose half their value if left solely in the realm of memory. And that is why I started this new blog.

That’s enough context for now. Until next time.
