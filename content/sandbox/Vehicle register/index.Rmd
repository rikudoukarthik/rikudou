I have loved cars from the time I can remember, whether it was our family cars in which we would spend hours and hours road-tripping across southern Africa, or my little plastic scooter or battery-operated car that I'd rally across our house, much to the annoyance (but occasional amusement) of my parents. Heck, I would even "air drive" both indoors and outdoors, imagining that I was driving the intriguing boxy Toyota Hiace vans that would pick me up and drop me off from school. And even then, I loved noting nerdy tidbits like the total distance air-driven in a day (as if I really understood what a kilometre felt like!).

Much more recently, I have been fortunate enough to actually drive/ride a fair bit myself. And, following my dad's advice, I made it a habit to maintain a fuel log for our own vehicles. I decided it would be fun to collate these datasets and explore some basic yet fun summaries. 

***Note:*** *Page last updated on `r lubridate::today()`, at which time vehicle logs were last updated on `r drive_reveal(our_gsheet, "modified_time") %>% mutate(modified_time = as_date(modified_time)) %>% pull(modified_time)`.*

## Suzuki Gixxer 150 aka Rogue {#rogue}

Almost immediately after I turned 18, I obtained my driving licence and my first vehicle. Leading up to this, I had already begged and persuaded my dad into gifting me this bike, because I had been itching for a very long time to get on the road myself. 

This was during my undergraduate years, and I did a whole lot of exploration and adventuring with this wonderful bike. As such, it is still very close to my heart, despite having been sold to my good friend before I left in 2019 for my master's in Czechia. 

![](rogue.jpg)

**Registration**: KL 70 C 6124

**Delivery taken date**: `r dates_first_last %>% filter(VEHICLE == "Gixxer Rogue") %>% pull(DATE.FIRST)`

**Total distance driven**: `r get_tot_dist("Gixxer Rogue") %>% pull(TOT.DIST)` km

**Last odometer reading**: `r data_veh %>% filter(VEHICLE == "Gixxer Rogue", !is.na(ODO)) %>% reframe(ODO = max(ODO)) %>% pull(ODO)` km (when sold)

## Nissan Micra {#micra}

The family car that we first got in 2015. It is unfortunately an automatic (CVT) transmission car, but is the vehicle I have driven the most and the longest, ever since I first starting driving cars. It has also been part of multiple intense birding road trips with me, especially during 2022--23.

![](micra.jpg)

**Registration**: KL 09 AJ 2477

**Delivery taken date**: 2015-04-??

**Total distance driven**: `r get_tot_dist("Micra") %>% pull(TOT.DIST)` km

**Last odometer reading**: `r data_veh %>% filter(VEHICLE == "Micra", !is.na(ODO)) %>% reframe(ODO = max(ODO)) %>% pull(ODO)` km

## Suzuki Gixxer 150 aka 0002 {#0002}

The first vehicle I purchased myself (with a loan from my dad that I paid off in instalments). My love for the Suzuki engine on this bike, and the sentimentality of Rogue together simplified my choice of bike this time around. Bought used after I returned to Bangalore from Czechia, the primary job description of this bike was commuting. Neither its previous owner nor I have shown it much of the country besides the Bangalore metropolitan area.

*Interestingly, the vehicle's registration number was a random draw---the previous owner did not pay to get the fancy number. It's rather fitting, since this is also my second Gixxer!*

![](0002.jpg)

**Registration**: KA 03 HY 0002

**Delivery taken date**: `r dates_first_last %>% filter(VEHICLE == "Gixxer 0002") %>% pull(DATE.FIRST)`

**Total distance driven**: `r get_tot_dist("Gixxer 0002") %>% pull(TOT.DIST)` km

**Last odometer reading**: `r data_veh %>% filter(VEHICLE == "Gixxer 0002", !is.na(ODO)) %>% reframe(ODO = max(ODO)) %>% pull(ODO)` km
