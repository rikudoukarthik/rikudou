Birding to me is a lot of things; at times, I see it as a sport. Given my love for numbers and my obsession with cricket stats as a kid (more on this coming soon!), I wanted to try and implement a similar sort of analysis and visualisation of sport statistics.

**Disclaimer:** All this is based off my data uploaded to eBird. That covers most, but not all, of the birding I have done.

# Career in numbers

My birding stats, as analysed from 6325 checklists. This only includes non–zero-species checklists, and this directly impacts metrics such as lowest speed.

# Career mapped

Spatial visualisation of my eBirding in the style of an eBird profile, but as a bigger sandbox… **Coming soon!**
