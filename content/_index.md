description: I am a researcher interested in birds and other organisms and their relationship with the environment and landscape. Beyond profession, birdwatching occupies a prominent role in my life and is much more than a hobby. I am also passionate about writing, especially poetry. I am currently in the process of structuring a framework for my life comprising these central interests of mine.
