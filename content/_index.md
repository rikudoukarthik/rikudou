subtitle: "Research Assistant @NCF India"
description: I am a researcher in ecology and my work revolves mostly around birds and their relationship with the environment. Beyond profession, birdwatching occupies a prominent role in my life and is much more than a hobby. I am also passionate about poetry. I am currently in the process of structuring a framework for my life comprised of these central interests of mine.
