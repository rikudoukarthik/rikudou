  I am Karthik Thrikkadeeri (alias Trick D. Eerie), a 26-year-old from Kerala, India. I am an ecologist, which means that I am interested in organisms and their relationships with each other and with the environment, and that I often spend my days thinking about various patterns in nature. It also means that I have a close relationship with numbers, often messy.

  Although I don’t know a fair many languages (and am not necessarily passionate about learning many), I do love how languages work. Consequently, I tend to get excited over small things like ingenious wordplay and writing with multiple layers to it. Irrespective of this though, I believe that there is immense power that writing holds. Lately, I have started to take my own writing more seriously and to integrate it better into my life.

  I love all things wild and free! Nature to me is endlessly exciting, intriguing and calming. I don’t *get lost* in nature as often as I’d like, and instead most often find myself looking and listening for birds (birding!). I am also obsessed with the Road, and more generally I tend to satiate my freeness- and lostness-cravings with travel, mostly preferring to go off the trodden path. As such, birding and travel for me have become inextricably linked.

  I consider myself to be a minimalist, and lament how everyone consciously or otherwise madly chases after *more*. I often find myself wistful for the “good old days”---times before even mine, but familiar (and alluring) to me almost as legend---and pondering on how it all would be if things were to change.

  If you’re interested in seeing more of my other exploits online, do check out my profiles on [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/ODQxNTky/world), where I have all my birding data (which also contributes to science!), [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/337978), where I keep all non-bird data, and [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/kartrick), where I track and review books.
