 I am Karthik Thrikkadeeri (alias Trick D. Eerie), a 22-year-old from Kerala, India, currently living in the Czech Republic. I am a student professionally and officially of ecology, but informally and more generally also of literature and philosophy (or so I like to think).

 Although I don’t know a fair many languages, I do love how languages work. Consequently, I tend to get excited over small things like ingenious wordplay and writing with many layers to it. Regardless, I believe that writing can be immensely powerful.

 I love all things wild and free! Nature to me is endlessly exciting, intriguing and calming. I don’t get lost in nature as often as I’d like, and instead most often find myself looking and listening for birds (birding!). I tend to satiate my freeness- and lostness-cravings with travel, mostly preferring to go off the trodden path.

 I consider myself to be a minimalist in all aspects of life. I constantly struggle with the way the world runs nowadays, and I lament how everyone consciously or otherwise madly chases after “more”. Highly old-fashioned in this regard, I often find myself wistful for the “good old days”---times before even mine, but familiar (and very attractive) to me almost as legend---and pondering on how it all would be if things were to change. Lately, I have realised that a lot of the ideas I have or stumble upon invariably link back to this in one way or another.

 If you’re interested in seeing more of my other exploits online, do check out my profiles on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7289090-karthik-thrikkadeeri), where I track and review books, and [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/ODQxNTky/world), where I have all my birding data (which also contributes to science!).
