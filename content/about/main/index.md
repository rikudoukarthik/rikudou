 I am Karthik Thrikkadeeri (alias Trick D. Eerie), a 24-year-old from Kerala, India. I am an ecologist, which means that I am interested in organisms and their relationships with each other and with the environment, and that I often spend my days thinking about various patterns in nature. It also means that I have a close relationship with numbers, often messy.

 Although I don’t know a fair many languages (and am not necessarily passionate about learning many), I do love how languages work. Consequently, I tend to get excited over small things like ingenious wordplay and writing with multiple layers to it. Irrespective of this though, I believe that there is immense power that writing holds.

 I love all things wild and free! Nature to me is endlessly exciting, intriguing and calming. I don’t *get lost* in nature as often as I’d like, and instead most often find myself looking and listening for birds (birding!). I tend to satiate my freeness- and lostness-cravings with travel, mostly preferring to go off the trodden path.

 I consider myself to be a minimalist in all aspects of life. I constantly struggle with the way the world runs nowadays, and I lament how everyone consciously or otherwise madly chases after “more”. Highly old-fashioned in this regard, I often find myself wistful for the “good old days”---times before even mine, but familiar (and alluring) to me almost as legend---and pondering on how it all would be if things were to change. Lately, I have realised that a lot of the ideas I have or stumble upon invariably link back to this in one way or another.

 If you’re interested in seeing more of my other exploits online, do check out my profiles on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7289090-karthik-thrikkadeeri), where I track and review books, and [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/ODQxNTky/world), where I have all my birding data (which also contributes to science!).
